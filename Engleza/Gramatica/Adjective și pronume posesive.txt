        Partea I: adjective posesive
Atunci când folosim adjective posesive, le plasăm mereu înaintea unui substantiv:
adjectiv posesiv + substantiv.

        Exemple
My book is on the table.
Are these your sunglasses?
Her husband is a musician.
That’s not his bag.
What is its name?
These aren’t our suitcases.
They are their children.



        Partea a II-a: pronume posesive
Folosim pronume posesive pentru a descrie o relație de proprietate atunci când substantivul despre care vorbim este evident, de exemplu:
Răspunzând la întrebări:
"Is that your dog?" "Yes, it’s mine."
"it's mine" means the same as "it's my dog" without repeating "dog".
Cu pronume demonstrative:
"This is mine."
"That's not his."
"Is the red one yours?"
Putem folosi pronume posesive și după substantiv, de exemplu atunci când vorbim despre ceva în particular:
That dog is mine.

        Exemple:
It's mine.
Which one is yours?
That's not hers.
That coat is his.
This is ours.
Is this room theirs?
